# Weather-Forecast-For-Aug-2023

## Description
Weather Forecast is an application that showes the 5 day weather forecast for any city you type in.  If you are going on a trip and need to know what kinds of clothing to wear, then you can simply check this app. Not only will you find the temperature displayed but also the humidity the wind speed, and a description of what the day will look like. For example if it is clear skies, raining or overcast.  All this information will be displayed for you.  Working with api's is not easy. This one tripped me up quite a bit. I had to reach out to a few resources to pull this one together.
